While creating a basic map on TileMill is relatively easy, the finished maps are still not as helpful as they could be. For one, in the case of homicides, while we can tweak the map to show which areas suffer from the most homicides, we don't know the reasons behind those numbers. For example, what are the gun laws in areas with higher shooting rates? Who can buy a gun and what, if any, are the background checks involved? Is the number of incidents directly related to a single mass shooting even like in Newtown, or are the numbers indicative of the average rate of incidents?
