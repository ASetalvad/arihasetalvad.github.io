### Query the database and create a list of every county (with state) that has acquired at least one mine-resistant armored vehicle. Then map that list 

### Query the database and find the most expensive single item that can be acquired through the 1033 program. Then generate a list of all counties that has so far acquired at least one of these things
The single most expensive item is listed as 'Aircraft, rotary wing' and each one costs 18000000. Apparently, Florida is the only state that has them, in Brevard county.

### Query the database to get the top 10 counties ordered by the total number of guns acquired through the 1033 program. Your answer should look very similar to what NPR found under the Total Guns Acquired graph (e.g. 3,452 guns for Los Angeles)

### Query the database to get the top 10 counties ordered by number of guns acquired per 1,000 people using the Census's 2013 population estimate. Again, your answers should look similar (but not exact) to what NPR found, e.g. 28 guns/1,000 people in Franklin, KY.
